# Find a proven skill

Use the `usethisskill` MCP server (installed with this plugin) rather than guessing from memory.

1. Call `search_skills` with a short description of the job (for example "landing page design", "write unit tests", "deploy to Vercel"). Read the top results.
2. For each candidate, call `get_skill` to read the install command, license and the SKILL.md description. Prefer a skill whose `proven` field is true: call `get_proof` to read the brief and the two result pages, and tell the user in one or two sentences what the skill changed.
3. Before recommending or installing any skill, call `check_skill` with its slug or GitHub URL. If the result is `flagged`, tell the user which pattern was found and where (file and line) and do not install it unless they ask after reading that. If it is `review`, show the listed lines and let the user decide. Do the same for any skill the user gives you as a GitHub link, even if it is not in the directory.
4. Recommend one skill. Show its one-line install command and where the folder lands (`.claude/skills/<name>/` in the project, or `~/.claude/skills/<name>/` for every project). Install it only if the user asks.
5. If no skill fits, say so plainly. Do not invent a skill name.

If the user wrote a skill of their own, `order_proof` explains how they can get it proven and listed.

Rules: never state that a skill works without a proof or the user's own test; always link the source repository; respect the skill's license.
